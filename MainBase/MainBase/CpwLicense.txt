/*  Cpw or "Cross-platform Windowing for OpenGL" is an adaptation of Mark        *

/*  use is granted with only minor restrictions. Please send any bug             *
/*  fixes, additional ports, and feedback to the cpw mailinglist address below.  *
/*  The GLUT 3.7 library was used as a framework in developing this code.        *
/*  Because of this I would like to graciously thank Mark Kilgard for his        *
/*  hard work on the GLUT library.                                               *
